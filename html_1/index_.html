            <h3>Here's a Brief Summary of the Stages of Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>WORD</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First Trimester (Week 1 - Week 12): This is the early stage of pregnancy when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and develops into an embryo. Major organs and systems begin to form, and the heart starts beating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second Trimester (Week 13 - Week 26): During this period, the fetus continues to grow rapidly. The mother may start to "show" as the uterus expands. Many women experience a decrease in symptoms like nausea and fatigue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third Trimester (Week 27 - Birth): In the final trimester, the fetus grows significantly and gains weight. The mother may experience more discomfort as the baby's movements become stronger. Labor typically begins around week 40, but it can vary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Labor and Birth: This is the culmination of pregnancy, where the uterus contracts to deliver the baby. This stage is divided into three phases: early labor, active labor, and delivery of the placenta.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Postpartum: This stage begins after the baby is born and lasts for about six weeks. The mother's body undergoes many changes as it begins to recover from pregnancy and childbirth.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>WHERE GOING DEEPER INTO EACH TERIMESTER LADIES</h3>
            <ol>
                 <li> First Trimester (Week 1 to Week 12):
                    Week 1-4: The fertilized egg implants itself in the uterus and begins to develop into an embryo.
                    Week 5-8: The embryo's major organs and body systems begin to form, and the heart starts beating. Facial features, arms, and legs begin to develop.
                    Week 9-12: The embryo is now called a fetus. It continues to grow rapidly, and by the end of the first trimester, all major organs are formed. The fetus is about the size of a plum. </li>
                 <li> Second Trimester (Week 13 to Week 26):
                    Week 13-16: The fetus's sex organs develop, and it may be possible to determine the baby's gender through ultrasound. The fetus begins to move, but the mother may not feel it yet.
                    Week 17-20: The mother may start to feel the baby's movements, known as "quickening." The fetus continues to grow, and its skin becomes covered with a waxy substance called vernix.
                    Week 21-24: The fetus's senses, such as hearing and taste, begin to develop. Eyebrows, eyelashes, and fingernails form.
                    Week 25-26: The fetus's lungs continue to develop, and it begins to practice breathing movements, although the lungs are not yet fully functional. </li>
                 <li> Third Trimester (Week 27 to Birth):
                    Week 27-30: The fetus's brain continues to develop, and it begins to open and close its eyes. The fetus's bones harden, but the skull remains soft and flexible to ease passage through the birth canal.
                    Week 31-34: The fetus continues to gain weight and develop fat stores. The mother may experience more discomfort as the baby grows larger and presses on her organs.
                    Week 35-38: The fetus's organs are nearly fully developed, and it continues to gain weight. The baby settles into a head-down position in preparation for birth.
                    Week 39-Birth: The baby is considered full-term and ready for birth. The mother may experience signs of labor, such as contractions and the rupture of the amniotic sac (water breaking). </li>
