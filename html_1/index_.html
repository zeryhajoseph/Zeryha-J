            <h3>Here's a Brief Summary of the Stages of Pregnancy</h3>

                <li>
                    First Trimester (Week 1 - Week 12): This is the early stage of pregnancy when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and develops into an embryo. Major organs and systems begin to form, and the heart starts beating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second Trimester (Week 13 - Week 26): During this period, the fetus continues to grow rapidly. The mother may start to "show" as the uterus expands. Many women experience a decrease in symptoms like nausea and fatigue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third Trimester (Week 27 - Birth): In the final trimester, the fetus grows significantly and gains weight. The mother may experience more discomfort as the baby's movements become stronger. Labor typically begins around week 40, but it can vary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Labor and Birth: This is the culmination of pregnancy, where the uterus contracts to deliver the baby. This stage is divided into three phases: early labor, active labor, and delivery of the placenta.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Postpartum: This stage begins after the baby is born and lasts for about six weeks. The mother's body undergoes many changes as it begins to recover from pregnancy and childbirth.
