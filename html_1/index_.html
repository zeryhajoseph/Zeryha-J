            <h2>EXERCISE TIPS!</h2>
            <p> Exercising during pregnancy can be beneficial for both the mother and the baby, but it's important to do so safely. Here are some general exercise tips for pregnant women:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Consult with your healthcare provider: Before starting any exercise program, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider to ensure that it's safe for you and your baby.</li>
            <li>Choose low-impact activities: Opt for exercises that are gentle on your joints and body, such as walking, swimming, stationary cycling, and prenatal yoga. These activities can help improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility without putting too much stress on your body.</li>
            <li>Listen to your body: Pay attention to how you feel during exercise. If you experience any discomfort, pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, stop exercising immediately and consult with your healthcare provider.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to stay hydrated. Dehydration can increase the risk of overheating and can be harmful during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Avoid lying flat on your back: After the first trimester, avoid exercises that require you to lie flat on your back for an extended period, as this can compress a major blood vessel and potentially reduce blood flow to the uterus.</li>

            <li>Warm up and cool down: Always start your exercise session with a gentle warm-up to prepare your body for activity, and end with a cool-down to help your heart rate return to normal and prevent muscle soreness.
            </li>
            <li>Pelvic floor exercises: Incorporate pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) into your routine to help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder, uterus, and bowels. Strong pelvic floor muscles can help prevent urinary incontinence and support your body during childbirth.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid overheating: Pregnancy can make you more sensitive to heat, so avoid exercising in hot and humid environments. Wear loose, breathable clothing, and exercise during cooler times of the day.
